% 1. INTRODUCTION
\section{INTRODUCTION}
\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the architecture of the system to be, CodeKataBlade, and to show how the requirements presented in the RASD document are met by the architecture. The document also contains the implementation, integration and test plan for the system.

\subsection{Scope}

CodeKataBlade is a software system designed to facilitate and enhance the practice of code katas, which are small coding exercises aimed at improving programming skills. The system provides a platform where educators can create tournaments and battles, and students can register, form teams, and submit their solutions to coding problems.

CodeKataBlade allows educators to create tournaments, which serve as spaces for organizing multiple battles. Educators can invite other educators to participate in tournaments and perform manual evaluations on the submissions of battles they own. The system also provides a leaderboard that is updated in real-time, displaying the rankings of participants based on their performance in the battles.

Students can register to tournaments and battles, either individually or as part of a team. They can submit their solutions to coding problems within the specified deadlines. The system automatically evaluates the submissions using build automation scripts and provides feedback to the students. A set of test cases is used to assess the correctness and efficiency of the solutions.

CodeKataBlade integrates with GitHub, a popular code hosting platform, allowing students to fork repositories and work on their solutions using version control. GitHub Actions, a CI/CD tool, is utilized to automate the evaluation process and provide continuous integration and delivery capabilities.

\section{ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN}
\subsection{Overview: High-level components and their interaction}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/3-tier-architecture.png}
    \caption{Three-tier Architecture}
    \label{fig:3-tier-architecture}
\end{figure}
The chosen architecture for the system is a three-tier architecture, a widely adopted
model for developing scalable and maintainable web applications. This architectural 
style divides the application into three interconnected layers: presentation, application, 
and data, with the addition of the external services like GitHub and email services.
The rationale behind selecting this architecture is to achieve separation of concerns, 
modularity, and scalability.

\subsubsection*{Presentation Layer}

The presentation layer constitutes the user interfaces for both students and educators, 
encompassing web or mobile interfaces. It is responsible for user interactions, 
displaying data, and triggering actions within the system.

\subsubsection*{Application Layer}

The application layer serves as the business logic layer, managing core functionalities 
such as user authentication, tournament and battle processes, submissions, and evaluations. 
It facilitates bidirectional communication with both the presentation layer and the data layer.

\subsubsection*{Data Layer}

The data layer, comprising the database and external services, handles the storage and 
retrieval of persistent data. It communicates with the application layer to respond to data 
requests, ensuring efficient data management.


% Interaction
\subsubsection{Interaction}
The interaction between the components is as follows:

% Presentation Layer and Application Layer
\subsubsection*{Presentation Layer and Application Layer}
The presentation layer communicates with the application layer through well-defined APIs. This interaction handles user inputs and actions, ensuring a smooth user experience.

% Application Layer and Data Layer
\subsubsection*{Application Layer and Data Layer}
The application layer interacts with the data layer to fetch or store information in the database. This interaction ensures that the platform has access to the necessary data for its operation.

% Application Layer and External Components
\subsubsection*{Application Layer and External Components}
External services, such as the GitHub API for code repositories and an email service for notifications, are integrated into the application layer. This interaction enhances the platform's functionality by incorporating external features.

\subsubsection{Advantages of Three-Tier Architecture}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Loose Coupling:} Separation of layers promotes loose coupling, enhancing 
    modularity and ease of maintenance.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} Each layer can be independently scaled based on specific 
    requirements, allowing for better performance and resource utilization.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/DeploymentDiagram.png}
    \caption{Deployment Diagram}
    \label{fig:DeploymentDiagram}
\end{figure}

On the deployment diagram, we can see the different components of the system and how they are 
deployed on the different nodes. In this case, the shown deployment assumes the application is developed on Java.
The web application runs on the users' PC which communicates with the
web server, which runs on a Web Server Technology which could be Apache Tomcat, Nginx or other. This two 
elements represent the presentation layer.
The web server is connected to the application server, which runs on a Java EE Application Server. This
element represents the application layer. The application server is connected to the database and to 
the external components. The database is managed by a Database Management System such as MySQL, PostgreSQL or other. 

\newpage

\subsection{Runtime view}

In the following diagrams we can see the sequence diagrams of the main functionalities of the system.
These are more fleshed out versions of the use case diagrams presented in the RASD document. It is important to 
note that the calls to the database server are just not depicted as they would in a real scenario, since these
are normally done via queries and not via custom method calls. It was represented via method calls so that
it is easier to understand the meaning calls to the database server and the parameters used.

\subsection{Selected architectural styles and patterns}

\paragraph{3-tier Architecture:}

As explained in the overview, the chosen architecture for the system is a three-tier architecture, a widely adopted
model for developing scalable and maintainable web applications. This architectural 
style divides the application into three interconnected layers: presentation, application,
and data, with the addition of the external services like GitHub and email services.

\paragraph{Model-View-Controller:}

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.
In the case of this system, it is used to separate the presentation layer from the application layer.

\paragraph{RESTful API:}

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.

    \item \textbf{Spring MVC:} To implement the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern for the backend.
    \item \textbf{Spring Data JPA:} For data access and manipulation with the database.
    \item \textbf{Hibernate:} As the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to map Java objects to database tables.
    \item \textbf{Thymeleaf:} For server-side rendering of HTML templates.
    \item \textbf{Angular or React:} For building the frontend application, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
    \item \textbf{MySQL or PostgreSQL:} As the relational database management system for storing persistent data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Plan}

The system should be developed in a bottom-up fashion, starting with the implementation of the core components and gradually adding more features and functionality. The implementation plan is divided into three phases, each focusing on a different aspect of the system.

\subsubsection*{Phase 1: Backend Development}

The first phase involves the development of the backend application, including the implementation of the business logic, data access layer, and RESTful APIs. This phase will be carried out in iterations, with each iteration focusing on a specific component or feature. The first iterations will focus on implementing the core components, such as the authentication manager, tournament manager, battle manager, and notification manager. Later iterations will focus on implementing the remaining components, such as the search manager and evaluation manager as well as the integration with external services.

\subsubsection*{Phase 2: Frontend Development}

The second phase involves the development of the frontend application, including the implementation of the user interface and client-side logic. This phase will also be carried out in iterations, with each iteration focusing on a specific feature of the Web Server and Web Application components. The first iteration will focus on implementing the user interface for the homepage, tournament page, and battle page with all of their respective functionalities.

\subsubsection*{Phase 3: Integration and Testing}

The third phase involves the integration of the backend and frontend applications as well as the testing of the system. This phase will be carried out in iterations, with each iteration focusing on a specific component or feature. The first iterations will focus on integrating the backend and frontend applications and testing the system at the unit level. Later iterations will focus on testing the system at the integration level and system level.

\subsection{Test Plan}

The test plan includes various types of testing to ensure the quality and reliability of the system.

\subsubsection*{Unit Testing:}
